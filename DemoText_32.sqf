DAC-Logic INTERN + Basic setup
\n\nIn order to change the basic setup of DAC, you can alter the ""DAC_Config_Creator"" file in your mission folder.
\n\nYou are not forced to store this file into your mission folder. It is possible to alter basic params via a Logic.
\n\nThis mission contains a logic which does this.
\n\nThis gives you the advantage to change the DAC2 setup in the ArmA2 ingame editor.
\n\nCheck the ""DAC_Config_Creator"" file in order to see which params you can change with this method. 
\n\nNote: This mission only contains half of the basic parameters you can use.
